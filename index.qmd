Founded in 1919, the Communist Party USA has championed the struggles for democracy, labor rights, womenâ€™s equality, racial justice and peace for 100 years. The Communist Party has an unparalleled history in the progressive movement of the United States, from the struggle against Jim Crow segregation, the organizing of the industrial unions, from the canneries of California, to the sweatshops of New York City.

This is the website of the Kentucky District of the Communist Party USA.

In the Party's structure, Districts usually conform to state borders. They are made up of all the clubs within their jurisdiction, and act as the intermediary between the Party's National Committee and the clubs, the most fundamental Party formation.

We welcome all Kentuckians who believe in justice and progress.
