The [Communist Party USA](https://cpusa.org) was founded on September 1, 1919.

The Kentucky District is composed of all the Party clubs and Young Communist League chapters in the Commonwealth. Once a District is approved by the Party's National Committee, the District elects leadership yearly and meets at regular intervals.

We are guided by the [CPUSA Party Program](https://cpusa.org/party_info/party-program/), although each District and Party club develops its own plan of work for the year as a result of careful analysis and democratic deliberation among all members.

Looking to find a Party club or YCL in your area? Send us an email via the link at the top or bottom of this page and we'll be in touch. Whether you're a seasoned organizer or you're still new to activism and politics, everyone has a role to play in building a better world.
