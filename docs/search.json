    "text": "Founded in 1919, the Communist Party USA has championed the struggles for democracy, labor rights, women’s equality, racial justice and peace for 100 years. The Communist Party has an unparalleled history in the progressive movement of the United States, from the struggle against Jim Crow segregation, the organizing of the industrial unions, from the canneries of California, to the sweatshops of New York City.\nThis is the website of the Kentucky District of the Communist Party USA.\nIn the Party’s structure, Districts usually conform to state borders. They are made up of all the clubs within their jurisdiction, and act as the intermediary between the Party’s National Committee and the clubs, the most fundamental Party formation.\nWe welcome all Kentuckians who believe in justice and progress."

    "text": "The Communist Party USA was founded on September 1, 1919.\nThe Kentucky District is composed of all the Party clubs and Young Communist League chapters in the Commonwealth. Once a District is approved by the Party’s National Committee, the District elects leadership yearly and meets at regular intervals.\nWe are guided by the CPUSA Party Program, although each District and Party club develops its own plan of work for the year as a result of careful analysis and democratic deliberation among all members.\nLooking to find a Party club or YCL in your area? Send us an email via the link at the top or bottom of this page and we’ll be in touch. Whether you’re a seasoned organizer or you’re still new to activism and politics, everyone has a role to play in building a better world."
